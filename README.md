## Project Description

This project is about using movie database and Marvel superheroes API to introduce the information and image of superheroes by searching and sorting.

## How to run

1. First, you should install all requirements with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Second, you should run `python SI507_finalProject.py runserver`.
3. Then open your browser and enter localhost 5000.

## How to use

1. Enter some keywords about the name of the character in the searching box to search the superheroes.
2. The result will show you related hero's name, description and wiki link and the picture of the hero.
3. (Optional): Markdown syntax to include an screenshot/image: ![alt text](image.jpg)

## Routes in this application
- `/` -> This is the home page. This page will show the upcoming Marvel movies and have a search tool for superheroes.
- `/superhero` -> This page will show the total numbers of superheroes.
- `/superhero/<hero_name>` -> This page will show the introduction of superheroes.
- /movie -> This page will show the total numbers of movies.
- /movie/<movie_name> -> This page will show the introduction of movies.


## How to run tests
1. First... (e.g. access a certain directory if necessary)
2. Second (e.g. any other setup necessary)
3. etc (e.g. run the specific test file)
NOTE: Need not have 3 steps, but should have as many as are appropriate!
